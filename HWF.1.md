# Homework F.1 - Final Project Tech Stack and MVP Proposal

We have deployed our web application on Netlify. The link to that has been provided in the Readme as well as here.

MVP- As a starting point, we would be creating a web application that combines the Recipes API and the Kroger API in a very fundamental way to display the the search results (recipes) returned from the Recipes API extracted using any recipe query. Then, we will list all the incredients and the quantities required for a particular recipe, and call the Kroger API to provide a way to purchase these ingredients.
