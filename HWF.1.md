# Homework F.1 - Final Project Tech Stack and MVP Proposal

We have deployed our web application using Netlify. The link to that has been provided in the Readme file.

MVP- As a starting point, we would be creating a web application that combines the Recipes API and the Kroger API in a very fundamental way to display the the search results (recipes) returned from the Recipes API extracted using any recipe query. Then, we will list all the incredients and the quantities required for a particular recipe, and call the Kroger API to provide a way to list the stores that are offering a particular ingredient and then purchase it. We still don't know what access levels do these APIs provide in the free tier, so our initial design would be very dependent on that. But the basic idea is- any user would be able to search for a recipe, get the results and then get the ingredients needed for that particular recipe.
