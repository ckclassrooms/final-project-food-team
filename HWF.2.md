Homework F.2 - Final Project MVP

We have deployed our react web application using Netlify. Link to deployed app: https://starlit-twilight-fde55f.netlify.app/

Right now, our app is able to do three things 
1) Show details (ingredients and instructions) about some preconfigured recipes
2) Allow users to search for any recipe and get the results list
3) Give users the option to visit the url of the recipe

Example-

This is the home page of our website. It has some recipe options shown to the users and a search bar to search for the recipes.

If the user search for "pizza", then they will get these results

This is the page that shows the detailed view about a recipe and the ability to select ingredient.

Our goal for the MVP was to have a functional website which would not only have the above features, but also allow the users to buy the ingredients using the Kroger API, which we haven't been able to do yet. So, our next goal would be to add the Kroger API, so that the users can see the prices of items and add those to their carts. Another goal would be to design the app better and provide more useful information, so that the users can have all the information they need in our app, without them going to the orginal url.
