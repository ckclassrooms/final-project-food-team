# final-project-proposal-food-team

In checkpoint 0, we had planned that this application will "allow users to get food recipes and then give them information about the recipe such as the price of the recipe/price of each individual ingredient, then allow the user to order the ingredients for delivery or pick up. Apart from this flow we will also allow users to search for recipes that include ingredients that they already own or have purchased before in another flow which is as follows: First we allow users to search for ingredients they own or include them if they have ordered them in the past, then allow them to add the ingredients to their owned list, then provide the user recipes that include the ingredients.
And optionally give users information about nutrition about the recipe from these sources/ APIsâ€™: FoodData Central (usda.gov) Nutrition API by Nutritionix"

As our Final Checkpoint, we have come very close to implementating most of the features that we sought to, even though haven't been able to provide the 'extra' functionality like recommendations due to time constraints.
Our app can be used to search for recipes (resulting list will be displayed), view an individual recipes's ingredients, search for and select a store via the Kroger Api using the zip code, and add some or all of those ingredients to the Kroger cart using the Kroger cart api.
