This application would allow users to get food recipes and then give them information about the recipe such as the price of the recipe, then the user would be able to order the ingredients for delivery or pick up. it is something like a hello fresh alternative. 
We would do something like this:
1. get a recipe from this api A Recipe APO with 2 Mllion Recipes - Recipe Search API - Edamam
2. get the ingredients and their prices from this api Products API Overview (kroger.com)
3. allow users to order the ingredients from this api Instacart Connect - The Instacart APIs | Instacart Connect Documentation
4. this is maybe optional but give users information about nutrition from these FoodData Central (usda.gov) Nutrition API by Nutritionix

What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information, and the ability to view / add to / change that information?

What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?
